## Description

Within this course, This course will test us on our skills for functional programming.   
The assignment itself would be a data visualization with [https://d3js.org/](D3js) with the data given to us.

## How to install

Soon™️

## Partner

With this course, we will be collaborating with [De volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/) to create meaningful digital interactive data visualizations that the journalists potentially use for internal research about the subject.

## Subject
For our partner De Volkskrant, we will be researching the following theme: **_' The car in the city'_**.

I will substantiate this particular theme with the data from RDW. This organization is the Netherlands Vehicle Authority in the mobility chain; they have kindly provided an open database in many categories or types.

Later in the wiki, I will specify to what subject I will hone towards in my research.

## Concept

My current concept, idea, research is about electric vehicles, specifically _**Which electric vehicles have an action radius of +250KM? How does this differ per car manufacturer?**_
